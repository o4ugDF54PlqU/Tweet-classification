# Tweet classification

These scripts were originally made as part of PPPNN, as a side project, but ending up having little relevance to the main project. These files processes a list of tweets from a number of users and tries to guess which user made which tweet. Essentially a reverse of the main project. Using k-folds of 4, the accuracy was below 50% due to limitations of input data.
